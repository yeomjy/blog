# Simplicial Complex

Simplicial complex is a way to represent topological space by vertices.

## Simplex

Let $\renewcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}v_0,\cdots, v_p \in \R^p$ such that $v_1 - v_0, \cdots, v_p - v_0$ are linearly independent.

___
**Definition (Geometric Simplex).**

___

A **geometric $p$-simplex** $\sigma_p = [v_0,\cdots, v_p]$ is a convex hull of $v_0,\cdots, v_{p}$, i.e.

$$
    [v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_p] = \left\{ \sum_{i=0}^{p} t_i v_i : 0\leq t_i \leq 1, \; \sum_{i=0}^{p} t_i = 1 \right\}
$$

and each $v_i$ is called a **vertex** of simplex.

___

The **standard $p$-simplex** is

$$
\Delta^p = [e_0,\cdots, e_p] \subset \R^p, e_0 = (0,\cdots, 0)
$$

We define a simplex spanned by a nonempty subset of vertices of $\sigma_p$ is a **face** of $\sigma_p$. i.e. $[v_{i_0}, \cdots, v_{i_k}]$ for some $1 \leq i_0<\cdots< i_k \leq p$ .

and we define $i$th **boundary face** $[v_0,\cdots, \hat{v}_i,\cdots, v_p]$. ($\hat{v}_i$ means $v_i$ is omitted)

## Simplicial Complex

___
**Definition (Simplicial Complex).**

___

A **simplicial complex $K$** is a collection of simplicies of various dimensions satisfying

1. If $\sigma \in K$, then every face of $\sigma$ is in $K$
2. The intersection of any two simplicies in $K$ is either empty or a face of each.

We denote a collection of all $p$-simplicies in $K$ by $K_p$.

## Chain Group

___
**Definition (Chain Group).**

___

Let $K_p$ be a $p$-simplex contained in simplical complex $K$, then we define a **chain group** $C_p(K)$ by

$$C_p(K)=\{ c_1 \sigma_1 + \cdots + c_{|K_p|} \sigma_{|K_p|}: c_i \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \left < \sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_{|K_p|} \right> \simeq \mathbb{Z}^{|K_p|}$$

, where the sum and multiplication is just a formal sum and formal multiplication.

___

With the multiplication and sum operation on chain, we can define **orientation** by

$$
 (v_{\sigma(0)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(p)})=\textrm{sgn}(\sigma)[v_0,\cdots, v_p]
$$

for any permutation $\sigma$.

### Boundary

___
**Definition (Boundary).**

___

We can define the **boundary map** $\partial_i: C_p (K) \rightarrow C_{p-1}(K)$ by

$$
\partial_i [v_0, \cdots, v_p] = \sum_{i} (-1)^{i} [v_0, \cdots, \hat{v}_i, \cdots, v_p]
$$

Note that the boundary map is a group homomorphism from $C_p(K)$ to $C_{p-1}(K)$.

___

The $(-1)^{i}$ factor is to make the boundary counter-clockwise.

Below image is helpful to understand the intution behind chain group and boundary.

## $\Delta$-complex

# Cell Complex and CW Complex

## Cell Complex

## CW Complex

# Homology

## Chain Complex

___
**Definition (Chain Complex).**

___

**Chain complex $C$** is a collcection of pairs $$\{(C_i, \partial_i)\}_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}$$ such that $C_i$ are free abelian group and
$\partial_i: C_i \rightarrow C_{i-1}$ is a group homomorphism such that
$$\partial _i \circ \partial_{i+1}=0$$ for all $i$.

We can think chain complex is an algebraic generalization of the notion of complex which we discussed above.

___

## Homology Group

___
**Definition (Homology).**

___

For a given chain complex $C$, **$k$th homology group $H_k$** is

$$
H_k(C) = \ker \partial_i/\textrm{im} \partial_{i+1}
$$

Since $\partial_{i} \circ \partial_{i+1}=0, \textrm{im}\partial_{i+1} \leq \ker \partial_i$ and homology groups are well-defined.

In topology, we consider a space $X$ and given chain complex $\{(C_i, \partial_i)\}_{i}$, and the chain groups $C_i$ are typically a module over $R$, then we write $H_k(X,R)$
