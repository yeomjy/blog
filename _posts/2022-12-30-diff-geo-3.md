# A Quick Introduction to Riemannian Geometry

## Riemannian Manifold

___
**Definition (Riemannian Manifold).**

___

A **Riemannian manifold** $M$ is a smooth manifold equipped smooth $(0,2)$-tensor field(bilinear form) $\renewcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}g_p : T_p M \times T_p M \rightarrow \R$ such that

$$
    \begin{align}
        &g_p(X, Y) = g_p(Y, X) & \textrm{(Symmetric)} \\
        &&\\
        &g_p(X, X) \geq 0 \textrm{ and } g_p(X,X) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow X = 0 & \textrm{(Positive definite)}
    \end{align}
$$

$g_p$ is called a **Riemannian metric**. In fact, it is a smooth assignment of *inner product* for each $T_p M$.

___

With the Riemannian metric, we can define a 'standard' local coordinate.

___
**Definition (Riemannian Normal Coordinate).**

## Volume Form

### Orientation via differential form

We seen that

$$
    d\tilde{x}_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d\tilde{x}_n = \det \left(\frac{\partial \tilde{x}_j}{\partial x_i}\right) dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_n
$$

holds for two local coordinate system $(x_1,\cdots, x_n), \; (\tilde{x}_1, \cdots, \tilde{x}_n)$.

Therefore, we can also define orientability in terms of differential form.

___

**Theorem (Orientation via nonvanishing $n$-form).**

___

$M$ is orientable if and only if there exists a $n$-form $\omega$ such that $\omega \neq 0$ everywhere.

**proof.**

(orientable $\implies$ nonvanishing $n$-form).

(nonvanishing $n$-form $\implies$ orientable).

Let us define pointwise orientation by $[v_1, \cdots, v_n]$ is positive
$\Longleftrightarrow \omega(p)(v_1, \cdots, v_n) > 0$, then
