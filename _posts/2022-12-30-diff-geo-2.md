> This post series is to give a short introduction about basic notions of differential geometry such as smooth manifold, differential form, and de Rham cohomology. I tried to introduce every notion as a natural generalization of calculus and undergraduate differential geometry about curves and surfaces.

# Integration of Differential Forms

For integrate the differential form on $M$, we need some preparation steps.

Let us define some preliminaries first.

## Partition of Unity

___
**Theorem (Partition of Unity).**

___

Let $$\renewcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}\mathcal{O} = \{U_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$$ be an open cover of $M$.
Then there exists a collection of compactly supported
$\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ functions
$$\mathcal{F}=\{\varphi_{i}:M\rightarrow [0,1] \;|\; \textrm{supp }(\varphi_{i})\subset U_{\alpha}, \alpha \in A\}$$ such that

$$
\sum_{\alpha\in A}\varphi_{\alpha}(p)=1 \quad \forall p \in M
$$

and for every $p \in M$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ containing $p$ such that there is only finite number of $i$ such that $\textrm{supp }(\varphi_i)\cap V \neq \emptyset$. This property is called *locally finite*.

We say $\mathcal{F}$ is a **partition of unity subordinate to $\mathcal{O}$**.

Note that the sum $\sum_{\alpha} \varphi_{\alpha}$ is finite sum for each $p$ due to locally finiteness.

___

## Orientability

To define integration on manifold, we first need the notion of *orientability*.

Because, if the manifold is not orientable, then

$$
\int_M \omega = -\int_M \omega
$$

holds and every integral value becomes 0.

First, let us define **orientation of vector space**.

___
**Definition (Orientation of Vector Space).**

___

Orientation is defined by an equivalence class of ordered basis such that for ordered basis $[v_1, \cdots, v_n], [u_1, \cdots, u_n]$, let $P$ be the transition matrix between basis. Then

$$
[v_1,\cdots,v_n] \sim [u_1,\cdots, u_n] \Longleftrightarrow \det P >0
$$

We choose an orientation $[v_1,\cdots,v_n]$ and say it **positively oriented**.

___

And we define $[e_1,\cdots, e_n]$, the standard orientation. We typically choose standard orientation to positively oriented.

For manifold, orientability is defined in terms of local coordinate.

___
**Definition (Orientability of Manifold).**

___

The manifold $M$ is orientable if there exists a collection of coordinate charts $$\mathcal{A}=\{(U_{\alpha}, \psi_{\alpha})\}_{\alpha}$$ such that for every $\alpha, \beta$, if $U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta} \neq \emptyset$, then

$$
    \det d(\psi_{\beta} \circ \psi_{\alpha}^{-1})(p) > 0, \quad \forall p \in U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}
$$

It means that the choice of orientation should be consistent with respect to transition map.

___

This definition means that for each $p, q \in M$, if the positive orientation of $T_pM$ is
$$
\left[\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\right|_{p}, \cdots, \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right|_{p}\right]$$,
then the postive orientation of $T_q M$ should be
$$\left[\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\right|_{q}, \cdots, \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right|_{q}\right]$$

Here is an example of non-orientable manifold, the famous mobuis strip.

*Image from: [stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3266689/do-all-non-orientable-have-to-close-in-some-direction)*

We seen that

$$
    d\tilde{x}_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d\tilde{x}_n = \det \left(\frac{\partial \tilde{x}_j}{\partial x_i}\right) dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_n
$$

holds for two local coordinate system $(x_1,\cdots, x_n), \; (\tilde{x}_1, \cdots, \tilde{x}_n)$.

Therefore, we can also define orientability in terms of differential form.

___

**Theorem**

___

$M$ is orientable if and only if there exists a $n$-form $\omega$ such that $\omega \neq 0$ everywhere.

**proof.**

___

### Induced Orientation

Now let us assume that $M$ has a boundary $\partial M$.

Then we can define a natural orientation on $\partial M$.

## Integration on Euclidean space

First, suppose that $\omega$ be a $n$-form on $\R^n$, $A \subset \R^n$.

Then, we can write $\omega = f dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_n$ for some smooth function $f: \R^n \rightarrow \R$.

Then,

$$
\int_{A} \omega := \int_{A} f dx_1 \cdots dx_n
$$

or, we can write $\int_A f dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_n = \int_A f dx_1  \cdots dx_n$

## Integration on Manifold

Now, let us assume that $\omega$ be a $n$-form on $n$-manifold $M$.
