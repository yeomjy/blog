# Integration of Differential Forms

For integrate the differential form on $M$, we need some preparation steps.

Let us define some preliminaries first.

## Partition of Unity

___
**Theorem (Partition of Unity).**

___

Let $$\renewcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}\mathcal{O} = \{U_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$$ be an open cover of $M$.
Then there exists a collection of compactly supported
$\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ functions
$$\mathcal{F}=\{\varphi_{i}:M\rightarrow [0,1] \;|\; \textrm{supp }(\varphi_{i})\subset U_{\alpha}, \alpha \in A\}$$ such that

$$
\sum_{\alpha\in A}\varphi_{\alpha}(p)=1 \quad \forall p \in M
$$

and for every $p \in M$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ containing $p$ such that there is only finite number of $i$ such that $\textrm{supp }(\varphi_i)\cap V \neq \emptyset$. This property is called *locally finite*.

We say $\mathcal{F}$ is a **partition of unity subordinate to $\mathcal{O}$**.

Note that the sum $\sum_{\alpha} \varphi_{\alpha}$ is finite sum for each $p$ due to locally finiteness.

___

## Orientability

To define integration on manifold, we first need the notion of *orientability*.

Because, if the manifold is not orientable, then

$$
\int_M \omega = -\int_M \omega
$$

holds and every integral value becomes 0.

First, let us define **orientation of vector space**.

___
**Definition (Orientation of Vector Space).**

___

Orientation is defined by an equivalence class of ordered basis such that for ordered basis $[v_1, \cdots, v_n], [u_1, \cdots, u_n]$, let $P$ be the transition matrix between basis. Then

$$
[v_1,\cdots,v_n] \sim [u_1,\cdots, u_n] \Longleftrightarrow \det P >0
$$

We choose an orientation $[v_1,\cdots,v_n]$ and say it **positively oriented**.

If $\det P <0$, we write

$$
   [v_1,\cdots, v_n] = -[u_1, \cdots, u_n]
$$

___

And we define $[e_1,\cdots, e_n]$, the standard orientation. We typically choose standard orientation to positively oriented.

For manifold, orientability is defined in terms of local coordinate.

___
**Definition (Orientability of Manifold).**

___

The manifold $M$ is orientable if there exists a collection of coordinate charts $$\mathcal{A}=\{(U_{\alpha}, \psi_{\alpha})\}_{\alpha}$$ such that for every $\alpha, \beta$, if $U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta} \neq \emptyset$, then

$$
    \det d(\psi_{\beta} \circ \psi_{\alpha}^{-1})(p) > 0, \quad \forall p \in U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}
$$

It means that the choice of orientation should be consistent with respect to transition map.

___

This definition means that for each $p, q \in M$, if the positive orientation of $T_pM$ is
$$
\left[\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\right|_{p}, \cdots, \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right|_{p}\right]$$,
then the postive orientation of $T_q M$ should be
$$\left[\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\right|_{q}, \cdots, \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right|_{q}\right]$$

Here is an example of non-orientable manifold, the famous mobuis strip.

___
**Definition (Orientation-preserving map)**

___

Let $M, N$ be $n$-manifolds.
$f: M \rightarrow N$ is **orientation-preserving** if $df$ maps postivie oriented basis to positive oriented basis.
And if $f$ is not orientation-preserving, $f$ is **orientation-reversing** map.

___

### Induced Orientation

Now let us assume that $M$ has a boundary $\partial M$.

Then we can define a natural orientation on $\partial M$ by the **outward vector**.

## Integration on Euclidean space

First, suppose that $\omega$ be a $n$-form on $\R^n$, $A \subset \R^n$.

Then, we can write $\omega = f dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_n$ for some smooth function $f: \R^n \rightarrow \R$.

Then,

$$
\int_{A} \omega := \int_{A} f dx_1 \cdots dx_n
$$

or, we can write $\int_A f dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_n = \int_A f dx_1  \cdots dx_n$

## Integration on Manifold

Now, let us assume that $\omega$ be a $n$-form on $n$-manifold $M$.

First, let us assume that $\textrm{supp } \omega \subset U_{\alpha} $ for some coordinate chart $(U_\alpha, \psi_{\alpha})$. Then we define

$$
    \int_{M} \omega := \pm\int_{\psi_{\alpha}(U)} (\psi_{\alpha}^{-1})^{*} \omega
$$

Note that $(\psi_{\alpha}^{-1})^{*} \omega$ is differential form in $\R^n$, which we defined previously.

The sign of integral is $+1$ if $\psi_{\alpha}$ is orientation-preserving and $-1$ if $\psi_{\alpha}$ is orientation-reversing.

Since $f^{*}(u d\tilde{x}_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d\tilde{x}_n) = (u \circ f) (\det df) dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_n$ and change of variables, the integral value does not depends on the choice of coordinate chart.

Now, let us assume general case.
Let $$\mathcal{A}=\{(U_{\alpha}, \psi_{\alpha})\}_{\alpha}$$ be an atlas of $M$.
Then, let $$\mathcal{F} = \{\varphi_i\}_{i}$$ be a partition of unity subordinate to $\mathcal{A}$, then
$\textrm{supp }\varphi_{i} \omega$ is contained in some $U_{\alpha}$, then we define

$$
    \int_M \omega := \sum_{i} \int_{M} \varphi_i \omega
$$

# Integration on Chain

The previous definition is easy to understand, but it can only integrate $n$-form in $n$-manifold.

Suppose that we integrate 1-form along the curve(1-manifold) on the surface(2-manifold) or $\R^3$(3-manifold).
Our definition cannot handle this situation.

Therefore, we will extend it with the notion of *chain*.

The notion of chain come from the *algebraic topology*. I'll explain it briefly here.
For more details, please see my [posts](/blog/posts/alg-top-1) or (Lee, 2010), (Hatcher, 2002).

## Simplicial Complex

Simplicial complex is a way to represent topological space by vertices.

### Simplex

Let $\renewcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}v_0,\cdots, v_p \in \R^p$ such that $v_1 - v_0, \cdots, v_p - v_0$ are linearly independent.

___
**Definition (Geometric Simplex).**

___

A **geometric $p$-simplex** $\sigma_p = [v_0,\cdots, v_p]$ is a convex hull of $v_0,\cdots, v_{p}$, i.e.

$$
    [v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_p] = \left\{ \sum_{i=0}^{p} t_i v_i : 0\leq t_i \leq 1, \; \sum_{i=0}^{p} t_i = 1 \right\}
$$

and each $v_i$ is called a **vertex** of simplex.

___

The **standard $p$-simplex** is

$$
\Delta^p = [e_0,\cdots, e_p] \subset \R^p, e_0 = (0,\cdots, 0)
$$

We define a simplex spanned by a nonempty subset of vertices of $\sigma_p$ is a **face** of $\sigma_p$. i.e. $[v_{i_0}, \cdots, v_{i_k}]$ for some $1 \leq i_0<\cdots< i_k \leq p$ .

and we define $i$th **boundary face** $F_{i,p}=[v_0,\cdots, \hat{v}_i,\cdots, v_p]$. ($\hat{v}_i$ means $v_i$ is omitted)

### Simplicial Complex

Simplicial complex is the collections of simplicies together represents a topological space.

___
**Definition (Simplicial Complex).**

___

A **simplicial complex $K$** is a collection of simplicies of various dimensions satisfying

1. If $\sigma \in K$, then every face of $\sigma$ is in $K$
2. The intersection of any two simplicies in $K$ is either empty or a face of each.

We denote a collection of all $p$-simplicies in $K$ by $K_p$.

### Chain Group

___
**Definition (Chain Group).**

___

Let $K_p$ be a $p$-simplex contained in simplical complex $K$, then we define a **chain group** $C_p(K)$ by

$$C_p(K)=\{ c_1 \sigma_1 + \cdots + c_{|K_p|} \sigma_{|K_p|}: c_i \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \left < \sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_{|K_p|} \right> \simeq \mathbb{Z}^{|K_p|}$$

, where the sum and multiplication is just a formal sum and formal multiplication.

___

With the multiplication and sum operation on chain, we can define **orientation** by

$$
 (v_{\sigma(0)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(p)})=\textrm{sgn}(\sigma)[v_0,\cdots, v_p]
$$

for any permutation $\sigma$.

### Boundary

___
**Definition (Boundary).**

___

We can define the **boundary map** $\partial_i: C_p (K) \rightarrow C_{p-1}(K)$ by

$$
\partial_i [v_0, \cdots, v_p] = \sum_{i} (-1)^{i} F_{i, p}
$$

Note that the boundary map is a group homomorphism from $C_p(K)$ to $C_{p-1}(K)$.

___

The $(-1)^{i}$ factor is to make the boundary counter-clockwise.

Below image is helpful to understand the intution behind chain group and boundary.

## Singular Chain

___
**Definition (Singular Simplex).**

___

A $p$-**singular simplex** in $M$ is a smooth map $\sigma: \Delta^{p} \rightarrow M$.

___

___
**Definition (Singular Chain).**

___

Similary, a $p$-**singular chain** is defined by $c=c_1 \sigma_1 + \cdots, + c_k \sigma_k$, where $\sigma_i$ are singular simplex.
And we denote the free abelian group $\left< \sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_k \right> = C_p(M)$ as we did previously.

___

___
**Definition (Boundary Map).**

___

Let $\sigma$ be a $p$-singular simplex, then the boundary map $\partial_p: C_p(M) \rightarrow C_{p-1}(M) $ is

$$
    \partial_p \sigma = \sum_{i} (-1)^{i} \sigma \circ F_{i, p}
$$

and for singular chain $c = \sum_{i} c_i \sigma_i $, then $\partial_p c := \sum_{i} c_i \partial_p \sigma_i$

___
## Integration on Chain

Now we can define integration on chain. Let $\sigma$ be a $p$-simplex, $\omega$ be a $p$-form on $M$, then

$$
    \int_\sigma \omega := \int_{\Delta^{p}} \sigma^{*} \omega
$$

and if $c = \sum_{i} c_i \sigma_i$, then

$$
    \int_{c} \omega := \sum_{i} \int_{\sigma_i} \omega
$$

For example, let $\Delta^{1} = [0, 1] = I$ be a unit interval. $M = \R^3$, then

$c=\sigma_1 : I \rightarrow \R^3$ is a parametrized curve on $M$. Then we can integrate one-form $df = \sum_{i} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} dx_i$
by the *line integral*

$$\int_{c} df = \int_{c}\sum_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}dx_i = \int_{[0,1]}  \sum_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (c_i(t)) \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial t} dt = \int_{[0,1]} (f \circ c)'(t) = f(c(1)) - f(c(0)) $$

And if we have piecewise curve $\sigma_i: [t_{i-1}, t_{i}] \rightarrow \R$, then we can express the whole curve by $c = \sum_{i} \sigma_i$, then the integral on whole curve is sum of piecewise integral, as desired.

## Integration on Manifold

Now let us show that definition by chain agrees with the previous definition.

___

**Defintion (Triangulation).**

___

A **triangulation** of a topological space $X$ is a homeomorphism $f: |K| \rightarrow X$
where $K$ is a simplical complex and

$$
    |K| := \bigcup_{\sigma \in K} \sigma
$$

is the **underlying space**.

___

This figure shows why it is called 'triangulation'.
Note that 2-simplex is triangle.

![triangulation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Dolphin_triangle_mesh.svg/375px-Dolphin_triangle_mesh.svg.png)
*Image from: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_%28topology%29)*

The below theorem is well-known fact.

___
**Theorem (Triangulation of Smooth Manifold).**

___

For any smooth manifold, there exists a *smooth* triangulation.

___

Suppose that the triangulation is given.

Then, we can think each simplex and triangulation map together as a singular simplex, and
it is also a coordinate chart.
Then you can easily check that two definition coincide.

**Remark**

If $\sigma: \Delta^p \rightarrow M$ is orientation-reversing map, then we can make it orientation-preserving by
$\tilde{\sigma} = \sigma \circ T$ where $\det T = -1$, e.g. $T(v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n) = (v_2, v_1,\cdots, v_n)$.

# Stokes’ Theorem

Now we can state the **stokes' theorem**.

___
**Theorem (Stokes' Theorem for Chain).**

___

Let $M$ be a compact, orientable $n$-manifold. $c$ be a $k$-chain in $M$, and $\omega$ be a $(k-1)$ form on $M$. Then

$$
    \int_{c} d\omega = \int_{\partial c} \omega
$$

Note that for $0$-simplex(a point), we define $$\int_{\sigma} f = \int_{\{0\}} \sigma^{*} f = f(\sigma(0))$$
Therefore when $p=1$ and $M=\R^1$, $\sigma(t)=t$, then

$$
     \int_{[0, 1]} f'(x)dx=\int_{\sigma} df = \int_{\partial(\sigma)} f = \int{\sigma(1) - \sigma(0)} f = f(\sigma(1)) - f(\sigma(0)) = f(1) - f(0)
$$

is the *fundamental theorem of calculus*.

___

___
**Theorem (Stokes' Theorem for Manifold).**

___

Let $M$ be a compact, orientable $n$-manifold. and $\omega$ be a $(n-1)$ form on $M$. Then

$$
    \int_{M} d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega
$$

Where the orientation of $\partial M$ is induced orientation.

___

**Remark**

1. The proof is omitted. But note that one can first prove stokes' theorem for chain and extend to stokes' theorem for manifold or reversely,
prove stokes' theorem for *manifold with corner* first and apply it to stokes' theorem for chain.

2. One may use singular chain $\sigma: I^k = [0, 1]^{k} \rightarrow M$ rather than $\Delta^k$.
This type of singular map is called *singular cube* and homology computation using this type of singular chain is called *cubical homology*.
If you use singular cube, than it is more easier to prove stokes' theorem for chain(it becomes iterated integral).

3. Sometimes we write
$\left<\left<M|d\omega\right>\right>=\left<\left<\partial M|\omega\right>\right>$, the meaning of this notation becomes more direct when we study *discrete differential geometry*.
