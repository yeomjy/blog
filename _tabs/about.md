I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science at Seoul National University.

I'm interested in mathematical theory of machine learning, including generalization of deep neural network,
optimization, GNN, RL.
I also interested in distributed computing, parallel computing, and backend programming and environments.

I write some posts about these topics to this blog.

For more information about me, see my [homepage](https://yeomjy.com).
