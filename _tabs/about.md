My name is Junyoung Yeom. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My research interests lie in the intersection of mathematics, deep learning, and theoretical computer science. Specifically, I'm interested in Neural Combinatorial Optimization, Neural Algorithmic Reasoning, Geometric Deep Learning, Machine Learning Theory, and Neural Program Synthesis.

Currently, I'm working as an undergraduate research intern at [Machine Learning Lab](https://mllab.snu.ac.kr), advised by [Prof. Hyun Oh Song](https://mllab.snu.ac.kr/hyunoh).
