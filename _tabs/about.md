I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science and mathematics at Seoul National University.

I'm interested in mathematical theory of machine learning, including generalization of deep neural network,
optimization, geometric deep learning, GNN, RL.
I am also interested in distributed computing, parallel computing, and backend programming and environments.

I write some posts about these topics to this blog.

For more information about me, see my [homepage](https://yeomjy.com).
