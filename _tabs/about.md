My name is Junyoung Yeom. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm also double majoring in mathematics.

I'm interested in Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization(via RL), Self-Supervised Learning, Causal Structure Learning, and Geometric Deep Learning.

Currently, I'm working as an undergraduate research intern at [Machine Learning Lab](https://mllab.snu.ac.kr), Seoul National University.
