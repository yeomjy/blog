My name is Junyoung Yeom. I'm a first-year Ph.D student in
Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University,
advised by [Prof. Hyun Oh Song](https://mllab.snu.ac.kr/hyunoh).

My research interests lie in the intersection of mathematics, deep learning, and theoretical computer science. Specifically, I'm interested in Neural Combinatorial Optimization, Neural Algorithmic Reasoning, Geometric Deep Learning, Computational Learning Theory, and Neural Program Synthesis.

In this blog, I write articles related in my research, or general topics on programming, computer science or mathematics.

If you want more information about me, please see my [website](https://yeomjy.com).
